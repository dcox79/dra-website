Technical Deep Dive

# Building a Defensible Azure Foundation

How we modernized cloud, identity, security, and governance for a regulated financial institution.

This engagement focused on modernizing cloud, identity, security, and governance foundations to support a regulated financial institution operating under FFIEC / GLBA expectations. The work spanned strategy, architecture, hands-on implementation, and automation, with a clear emphasis on **control-plane rigor, repeatability, and audit defensibility**.

## 1\. Azure Platform & Landing Zone Strategy

### Objectives

*   Establish a bank-grade Azure foundation aligned to Microsoft ESLZ
*   Enforce strong separation of duties across management, identity, and networking

### Work Completed

*   Defined subscription hierarchy and management group structure (Platform vs. Workload)
*   Designed policy-driven governance model with Azure Policy initiatives
*   Established naming standards and resource conventions
*   Documented Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for audit trails

**Outcome:** A defensible, regulator-friendly Azure foundation that prevents ad-hoc sprawl.

## 2\. Identity & Access Control (Entra ID)

### Objectives

*   Centralize identity control and minimize standing privilege
*   Support strong audit evidence

### Work Completed

*   Implemented Privileged Identity Management (PIM) with JIT elevation
*   Defined break-glass access strategy with Conditional Access exclusions
*   Established admin role separation to avoid Global Admin reliance
*   Designed Conditional Access patterns with "What-If" testing

**Outcome:** Identity is no longer “trust-based”; it is policy-enforced and auditable.

## 3\. Network Architecture (Hub-and-Spoke / vWAN)

### Objectives

*   Centralize connectivity and inspection
*   Support hybrid banking workloads without flat routing

### Work Completed

*   Designed Azure Virtual WAN hub architecture
*   Defined hub/spoke segmentation for workload isolation
*   Standardized DNS architecture with Private DNS zones
*   Defined routing strategy to avoid transitive trust

**Outcome:** Network design favors deterministic routing and inspection, not convenience.

## 4\. Security Controls & Inspection

### Objectives

*   Enforce centralized traffic inspection
*   Reduce lateral movement risk

### Work Completed

*   Designed Azure Firewall Premium architecture with centralized policy
*   Defined rule taxonomy (DNAT vs Network vs Application)
*   Standardized logging and diagnostics for flow visibility

**Outcome:** Security is explicitly engineered, not bolted on.

## 5\. Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)

### Objectives

*   Secure remote access to banking workloads
*   Enforce location-based access control

### Work Completed

*   Designed AVD access control model
*   Authored Conditional Access PRD specific to AVD
*   Designed policy comparison framework and What-If testing approach

**Outcome:** AVD access is intentionally constrained, not broadly permissive.

## 6\. Logging, Monitoring & Audit Readiness

### Objectives

*   Provide audit evidence on demand
*   Avoid reactive log hunting

### Work Completed

*   Defined Log Analytics workspace strategy
*   Standardized diagnostic settings for platform and security services
*   Built KQL patterns for firewall traffic and security events

**Outcome:** Audit questions can be answered with queries, not guesswork.

## 7\. Automation & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Objectives

*   Eliminate click-ops and ensure repeatability
*   Reduce configuration drift

### Work Completed

*   Standardized Bicep-first deployment approach
*   Defined parameterized templates for platform and security controls
*   Established GitHub-based workflow for source-controlled infrastructure

**Outcome:** Infrastructure changes are reviewable artifacts, not console actions.

## 8\. Documentation & Stakeholder Artifacts

### Objectives

*   Enable executive understanding and support regulators
*   Create long-term institutional knowledge

### Work Completed

*   Architecture diagrams (platform, identity, network)
*   Formal PRDs for security initiatives
*   Decision logs explaining _why_, not just _what_

**Outcome:** The program is explainable, not opaque.

## 9\. What We Explicitly Did NOT Do

To be clear and direct, this was intentional and appropriate for a regulated bank:

*   No unmanaged services
*   No 24×7 SOC or NOC operations
*   No vendor-driven “black box” designs
*   No shortcutting governance for speed

Special Focus

## AI Foundry Workstream

The AI Foundry effort was treated as a **regulated platform capability**, not a “data science sandbox.” The goal was to enable GenAI workloads without weakening the bank’s security posture.

### Core Design Principles

*   •**Identity-first:** Managed Identities / Service Principals
*   •**Private-only:** Private endpoints + private DNS
*   •**Centralized logging:** Audit trails for compliance
*   •**Tight guardrails:** Policy enforcement

### Practical Outcomes

*   ✓No uncontrolled public endpoints
*   ✓No mystery authentication
*   ✓No “we’ll figure out logging later”
*   ✓No one-off snowflake builds
