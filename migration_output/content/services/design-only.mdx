*   Target-state architecture & guardrails
*   Implementation-ready design pack
*   Security & compliance mapping

### ✔ When this is the right choice

*   You have an internal team or MSP to build, but need a vetted design
*   You are migrating to Azure and want to avoid rework
*   Security wants patterns documented before approvals
*   You need an ESLZ / governance model before onboarding

### ✖ Not a fit if...

*   You need hands-on delivery next week
*   You want a lightweight slide deck instead of artifacts
*   You have no one to implement the designs

## What We Design

We provide complete design tracks for your enterprise.

### Enterprise Landing Zone

Governance, subscription organization, and policy.

*   Management groups
*   RBAC/PIM model
*   Azure Policy guardrails

### Identity & Access

Hybrid identity, SSO, and secure access patterns.

*   Entra ID strategy
*   Workload identity
*   B2B collaboration controls

### Network Connectivity

Robust, scalable networking for hybrid clouds.

*   vWAN/Hub-Spoke
*   ExpressRoute/VPN
*   Firewall & Egress

### Security Architecture

Zero Trust alignment and detection strategy.

*   Zero Trust alignment
*   Logging & Detection
*   Key/Secret management

## Design Methodology

A collaborative process to ensure the design fits your reality.

1

### Discovery Workshops

Week 1

We gather requirements, constraints, and compliance needs.

#### Key Deliverables:

*   Requirements doc
*   Constraints map

2

### Target-State Architecture

Week 2-3

We define the reference architecture and core patterns.

#### Key Deliverables:

*   Draft architecture
*   Decision records

3

### Design Pack Production

Week 4-6

We produce the detailed diagrams and specifications.

#### Key Deliverables:

*   Final Design Pack
*   Implementation plan

## The Design Pack

Everything your engineers need to start building.

### Architecture Diagrams

Detailed HLD/LLD diagrams for network, identity, and flows.

### Decision Records (ADRs)

Documented 'why' behind every major architectural choice.

### Implementation Plan

Sequenced steps, dependencies, and risk mitigation.

### Backlog Artifacts

Epics and user stories ready for your agile tool.

## Included vs. Not Included

### Included

*   Target-state architecture
*   Design documentation & diagrams
*   Decision/Assumption registers
*   Implementation guidance

### Not Included

*   Hands-on build/configuration
*   Managed services
*   Code development beyond IaC templates

## The Outcome

Build faster and safer with a blueprint.

### Faster Implementation

Reduce engineering churn and reversals during the build.

### Audit Confidence

Pre-validated security controls documented in design.

### Standardization

Repeatable patterns for future expansion.

## Common Questions

How is this different from an assessment?

Will you provide IaC templates?

Can you review our team's build?
