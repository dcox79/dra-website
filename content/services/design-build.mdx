*   Production-ready landing zones
*   Secure identity & network implementation
*   Automated guardrails (IaC)
*   Cutover-ready plans

### ✔ When this is the right choice

*   You need to move fast without overloading internal teams
*   Prior attempts failed due to lack of execution
*   You have a high-risk or complex environment
*   You want measurable outcomes and accountable delivery

### ✖ Not a fit if...

*   You only need documentation (see Design-Only)
*   You need staff augmentation bodies
*   You need ongoing 24/7 managed services

*   Management Groups
*   RBAC/PIM
*   Azure Policy initiatives

### Identity Implementation

Secure Entra ID and access controls.

*   Conditional Access
*   Privileged Access
*   Workload Identity

### Network Implementation

Connectivity and protection.

*   vWAN/Hub-Spoke
*   Firewalls/NVA
*   Private DNS

### Security Baseline

Defensive controls and monitoring.

*   Defender for Cloud
