## Why “Default Route”?

In networking, the **Default Route (0.0.0.0/0)** is the path traffic takes when no other specific path is known. It's the fail-safe. The catch-all. The path of last resort.

We founded Default Route Advisory to be that path for organizations stuck in the complexity of Azure adoption. When your internal teams are blocked, when the generalist MSP doesn't have the answer, and when the documentation is ambiguous—we are the route forward.

We don't try to be everything to everyone. We focus relentlessly on the core infrastructure—**Identity, Networking, and Governance**—that makes or breaks your cloud environment.

0.0.0.0/0

The Route of Last Resort

## Our Principles

We operate differently than traditional consulting firms.

1

### Defensible Design

We assume you will be audited. Every architecture decision we make is documented, justified, and built to withstand scrutiny from CISOs and regulators.

2

### Execution Over Theory

Slides don't run in production. We deliver CLI scripts, Bicep templates, and specific configurations that your engineers can actually implement.

3

### Honest Boundaries

We tell you what we don't do. We don't build websites, we don't migrate SAP, and we don't do 24/7 support. We stay in our lane so we can be the best at it.
