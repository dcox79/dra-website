Case Study

# Enabling Epic MyChart Through Control-Plane Ownership

## Executive Summary

Enabled Epic MyChart by reclaiming identity and DNS ownership in a **71-hospital Azure healthcare environment**, without downtime or disruption to patient care.

This engagement transitioned a large healthcare provider from an MSP-managed identity and DNS model to an **Azure-native, provider-owned control plane**, meeting Epic's security and governance requirements while establishing a scalable foundation for future digital health initiatives.

71

27K+

Identities Migrated

47

Zero

Downtime

## The Challenge

Epic MyChart readiness was blocked by foundational infrastructure constraints:

*   ✗Identity and DNS controlled by third parties
*   ✗Limited auditability and change governance
*   ✗Slow response to security and compliance requirements

Without direct ownership of the control plane, Epic deployment could not proceed.

## The Solution

We transitioned the organization from an MSP-managed environment to an **Azure-native identity and DNS architecture** owned and operated by the provider.

The solution preserved federated authentication, eliminated opaque third-party dependencies, and delivered authoritative DNS and identity governance aligned with Epic's compliance standards—**with zero downtime**.

## Architecture Transformation

From MSP-Controlled to Provider-Owned Control Plane

## Executed at Enterprise Healthcare Scale

### 71 hospital sites

Connected via multi-region Azure Virtual WAN

### 6,000+ concurrent sessions

Azure Virtual Desktop supporting clinicians

### 27,000+ user identities

Migrated without authentication disruption

### 47 public DNS zones

Consolidated under Azure DNS

### Zero downtime

During migration and cutover

### Epic MyChart ready

Technical readiness achieved

## The Outcome

*   ✓Epic MyChart deployment unblocked
*   ✓Direct ownership of identity and DNS established
*   ✓Auditability and security posture materially improved
*   ✓MSP dependency removed from security-critical systems
*   ✓Azure platform positioned for continued healthcare modernization

> “We could not move forward with Epic MyChart until we owned our identity and DNS control plane.”
