Case Study

# Modernizing a Financial Institution: Bank-Grade Azure Foundation & AI Foundry

## Executive Summary

We delivered a **controlled operating environment** with identity-first security, deterministic networking, and auditable controls for a regulated financial institution.

This engagement modernized cloud, identity, security, and governance foundations to support FFIEC / GLBA expectations. The work spanned strategy, architecture, hands-on implementation, and automation, with a clear emphasis on control-plane rigor, repeatability, and audit defensibility.

## The Challenge

The institution needed to modernize its platform while strictly adhering to regulatory expectations:

*   ✗Need for strong separation of duties across management, identity, and networking
*   ✗Requirement to eliminate ad-hoc sprawl and enforce policy-driven governance
*   ✗Transition from trust-based identity to policy-enforced access
*   ✗Secure enablement of GenAI workloads without weakening security posture

## The Solution

We established a **bank-grade Azure foundation** aligned to Microsoft Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone (ESLZ) guidance.

The solution included a robust Entra ID governance model, a secure Hub-and-Spoke network architecture with Azure Virtual WAN, and a specialized AI Foundry landing zone for regulated AI workloads.

## The Outcome

*   ✓Identity is no longer “trust-based”; it is policy-enforced and auditable
*   ✓Network design favors deterministic routing and inspection
*   ✓Infrastructure changes are reviewable artifacts via IaC
*   ✓AI workloads enabled with private connectivity and full audit trails
*   ✓Audit questions can be answered with queries, not guesswork
